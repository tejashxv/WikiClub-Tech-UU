Technology is moving faster than ever, and being part of communities that nurture innovation makes the journey even more exciting. Recently, I had the opportunity to attend **Geminixplore â€“ CLI & AI Paper Reading**, an event hosted by **WikiClub Tech, United University** in collaboration with **TensorFlow User Group Prayagraj** and supported by **Google for Developers**.

This event was a unique mix of learning, hands-on exploration, and community building.

## What Made This Event Special?

### 1. AI Study Jam

We kicked off with an **AI Study Jam** where we explored the foundations of Artificial Intelligence and discussed some of the latest research papers in the field. Reading and interpreting AI research papers as a group was not only enriching but also made complex concepts more approachable.

The session was highly interactive, with attendees actively participating in the discussion and sharing their insights. It provided a much-needed platform for students to come together and learn from each other.

### 2. Hands-On Session with Gemini CLI

One of the most exciting parts was getting hands-on with **Gemini CLI**. It was a practical, step-by-step session where we learned how to interact with AI models directly from the command line. This experience gave me a glimpse of how powerful CLI-based workflows can be for developers, researchers, and students alike.

**Ankit Kumar Verma**, a prominent figure in the tech community, guided us through the process. We learned how to leverage the power of Gemini to perform a variety of tasks, from generating code to summarizing complex research papers. The session was a real eye-opener, showcasing the immense potential of CLI-based workflows in the age of AI.

### 3. Inauguration of Road to WIKI Cohort 2

The event also marked the beginning of **Road to WIKI Cohort 2**, a new phase of learning and collaborative projects. This initiative promises to provide a structured path for participants to engage in impactful AI and open-source projects.

The cohort aims to provide a platform for students to work on real-world projects, develop their skills, and build a strong portfolio.

## The People Who Made It Happen

A big thanks to **Ankit Kumar Verma**, whose guidance and insights made the sessions engaging and meaningful. His way of breaking down technical concepts into practical takeaways was a huge learning experience for me.

Events like these are not just about knowledge transfer, but about sparking curiosity, encouraging collaboration, and preparing us for the future of technology.

## Why Events Like This Matter

For students and developers like me, such initiatives are game-changers. They:

- **Provide hands-on exposure** to cutting-edge tools
- **Encourage us to read and understand research papers**, bridging the gap between theory and practice
- **Build a community** of like-minded learners who support and motivate each other

Being supported by **Google for Developers** and connected with communities like **TensorFlow User Group Prayagraj** makes it even more impactful, because it shows how global tech ecosystems can empower local innovation.

## Final Thoughts

Attending **Geminixplore â€“ CLI & AI Paper Reading** was an inspiring journey. I walked away not only with practical skills on Gemini CLI but also with a renewed sense of excitement about the future of AI.

Geminixplore was more than just a tech event; it was a celebration of learning, collaboration, and community. The event was a testament to the vibrant tech culture at United University and the passion of its students.

I'm looking forward to applying what I learned in my own projects and to contributing to the initiatives coming out of **Road to WIKI Cohort 2**.

A heartfelt thank you to the organizers for creating such an enriching platform for us to learn, collaborate, and grow. ðŸŒŸ
